      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I build and operate reliable systems with a strong focus on automation,
        stability, and scalability. My work revolves around designing CI/CD
        pipelines, improving deployment workflows, and reducing manual
        intervention through cloud-native practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        I care deeply about system reliability, clean infrastructure design,
        and solving problems at the root rather than applying temporary fixes.
